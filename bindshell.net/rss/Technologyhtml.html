			<title>IP/Human</title>
			<link>http://bindshell.net/entry/29</link>
			<description>The somewhat contentious inclusion of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags into clothing and other products provides a new, but somewhat slow, method of communication: &quot;Transmission of IP Datagrams on Human Carriers&quot;. Whilst this falls under the same umbrella as the 1990 April Fools Day RFC for transmitting IP over carrier pigeon, it is still possible and probably quicker.  </description>

			<title>Because I Can</title>
			<link>http://bindshell.net/entry/11</link>
			<description>Why write a “UN*X-like OS” fully in Javascript? Because you can… Norbert Landsteiner has written a functioning terminal only in Javascript. It has the look and feel of a standard terminal contained within the browser. It is certainly worth 5 minute explore. http://www.masswerk.at/jsuix/  </description>

			<title>Relative Absoluteness</title>
			<link>http://bindshell.net/entry/10</link>
			<description>HTML/CSS positioning has always had be pulling my hair out, with absolute positioning being the largest threat to my coiffure.  Well, today I found an excellent artical on all aspects of CSS positioning at BrainJar.com.  Here's the excerpt that finally made everthing make sense to me:  The containing block of an absolutely positioned element is defined a little differently than it is for other elements. The containing block for an absolutely positioned element is established by its closest, positioned ancestor. That is, the nearest element outside it that has a position of absolute, relative or fixed. If there is no such ancestor element, the initial containing block (the browser window) is used.//  The full artical can be found here:      http://www.brainjar.com/css/positioning/default.asp  The section on absolute positioning is on page 4.  </description>

			<title>Structured Exception Handling</title>
			<link>http://bindshell.net/entry/7</link>
			<description>Today I have been mainly learning about Structured Exception Handling (SEH).  Unlike normal Exception Handling (EH), implemented at a compiler level by generic C++ compilers, SEH is implemented in Windows at an operating system level.  The details on how to use SEH are available from Microsoft, and there's a nice artical on Gamedev.net as well, but that's not what I'm interested in...  The actually implementation details are far more interesting.  There's a couple of interesting articles on this by Matt Pietrek and Jeremy Gordon.  And, hey, guess what?  There's a whole heap (no pun intended) of intesting stuff being stored on the stack...  Update 23-May-2006: Fixed bad link.  My bad.  </description>

			<title>Tiddly But Cool</title>
			<link>http://bindshell.net/entry/6</link>
			<description>TiddlyWiki is a fantastic little toy.  It presents an entire Wiki in a single HTML file.  No webserver, no database, just a single HTML file.  A whole heap of CSS/Javascript magic goes on behind the scenes to save any edits back to the orginal HTML file, making it eminently portable.  You can drop this thing on a USB token and carry around a self contained notebook that you can update using whatever computing you happen to have access to.  </description>
