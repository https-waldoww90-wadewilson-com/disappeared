			<title>ETrace 1.1 Released</title>
			<link>http://bindshell.net/entry/17</link>
			<description>ETrace 1.1 has finally been released (get the goodness here).  I say finally, not because you've all been stuck with version 1.0, but because this is the first time any version of ETrace has been publicly released.  ETrace was born back in 2001, created by the fertile (and often twisted) minds of the folks in ISS X-Force Security Assessment Services.  Glyn Geoghegan provided the original idea and, once the initial version was up and running, David Morgan then provided some of the most detailed feedback ever seen.  So there it is.  Thanks Glyn, thanks Dave...  Please leave me alone now.  </description>

			<title>Relative Absoluteness</title>
			<link>http://bindshell.net/entry/10</link>
			<description>HTML/CSS positioning has always had be pulling my hair out, with absolute positioning being the largest threat to my coiffure.  Well, today I found an excellent artical on all aspects of CSS positioning at BrainJar.com.  Here's the excerpt that finally made everthing make sense to me:  The containing block of an absolutely positioned element is defined a little differently than it is for other elements. The containing block for an absolutely positioned element is established by its closest, positioned ancestor. That is, the nearest element outside it that has a position of absolute, relative or fixed. If there is no such ancestor element, the initial containing block (the browser window) is used.//  The full artical can be found here:      http://www.brainjar.com/css/positioning/default.asp  The section on absolute positioning is on page 4.  </description>

			<title>Arctic Monkeys At The Crocodile</title>
			<link>http://bindshell.net/entry/9</link>
			<description>Caught the Arctic Monkeys last night at the Crocodile Cafe, Speaker Speaker opened.  The gig had been pushed on the radio all week, and tickets had sold out a month or so ago so the Croc was rammed.  Not my usual cup of tea, but they were both pretty good, and I'm a big fan of actual music, you know, with actual people using actual instruments.  </description>
