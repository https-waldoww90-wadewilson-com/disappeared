			<title>ETrace 1.1 Released</title>
			<link>http://bindshell.net/entry/17</link>
			<description>ETrace 1.1 has finally been released (get the goodness here).  I say finally, not because you've all been stuck with version 1.0, but because this is the first time any version of ETrace has been publicly released.  ETrace was born back in 2001, created by the fertile (and often twisted) minds of the folks in ISS X-Force Security Assessment Services.  Glyn Geoghegan provided the original idea and, once the initial version was up and running, David Morgan then provided some of the most detailed feedback ever seen.  So there it is.  Thanks Glyn, thanks Dave...  Please leave me alone now.  </description>
