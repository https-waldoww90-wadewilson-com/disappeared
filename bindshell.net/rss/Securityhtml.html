			<title>Inter-protocol Exploitation and Communication papers</title>
			<link>http://bindshell.net/entry/38</link>
			<description> Two papers are now available that demonstrate inter-protocol security issues - Inter-protocol Communication and Inter-protocol Exploitation. Among other things they show the practicality of encapsulating exploit code in one protocol to compromise a program which uses a different protocol.   An example is provided that shows how a web browser can launch a MetaSploit type exploit to own an Asterisk server. Of course, this raises concerns over the (in)effectiveness of firewalls against this attack.  </description>

			<title>Manipulating FTP Clients Using The PASV Command Paper</title>
			<link>http://bindshell.net/entry/34</link>
			<description>A common implementation flaw in FTP clients allows FTP servers to cause clients to connect to other hosts. This seemly small vulnerability has some interesting consequences for web browser security.  This paper discusses how the flaw affects Firefox, Opera and Konqueror.  </description>

			<description>This paper explores the real potential of the web being infected with a cross-site scripting virus that autonomously searches for, and employs, new vulnerabilities for propagation.  </description>

			<title>BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework) Beta Released </title>
			<link>http://bindshell.net/entry/23</link>
			<description>BeEF the browser exploitation framework has been released. The current version is beta and still a work in progress but it should be easy to install.  Its purposes in life is to provide an easily integratable framework to demonstrate the impact of browser and cross-site scripting issues in real-time. The modular structure has focused on making module development a trivial process with the intelligence existing within BeEF.  </description>

			<title>HTTP Penetration Suite</title>
			<link>http://bindshell.net/entry/22</link>
			<description>Attacks from browsers are increasing in sophistication and researchers are focusing more resources in this area. Recently, a javascript port scanner was published that was based on a SPI Dynamics paper. The scanner is entirely encapsulated within the web browser.   It doesn’t take an Einstein to start linking web application attack vectors. In the “Inter-browser Communication” (IBC) blog I illustrated one basic method to maintain indirect real-time control over a browser (including data transfer). Using IBC it possible to load tools (in real-time) such as a port scanner to the controlled browser and retrieve the results. Following this logic, an entire HTTP Suite can be developed to attack internal networks using the browser as an unsuspecting proxy. Not to mention the extra dimensions that XSS viruses add.  </description>

			<title>Inter-browser Commutation </title>
			<link>http://bindshell.net/entry/12</link>
			<description>Cross-site scripting (XSS) models are commonly thought to be the server controlling the browser. That is, all commands have come from code residing on the server. This is not necessarily the case. Control can be one browser (in)directly controlling/communicating to another. One method of browser-to-browser communication is employing an intermediate web server.  </description>
