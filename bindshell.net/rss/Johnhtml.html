			<title>New password cracking tool Dnetj and updates to John The Ripper MPI</title>
			<link>http://bindshell.net/entry/41</link>
			<description>For those people wanting to crack password hashes, there is a minor update (john-1.7.2-mpi5) to the MPI cluster patch for John The Ripper available Here as well as a completely new tool called Dnetj which is available Here  Dnetj is a client/server wrapper around John The Ripper that allows the use of a central server and any number of cracking nodes, in much the same way setiathome or distributed.net works.  The server loads a set of password hashes, and splits the available keyspace into &quot;work units&quot; of a configurable size. The clients connect and retrieve the hashes, as well as a set of work units to process. Once a client has processed some work units, it connects back to the server to submit the completed units as well as any passwords which have been cracked.  This is a very early release, and although functional there could well be bugs.  </description>
