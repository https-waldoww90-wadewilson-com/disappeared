		<description>Hi Erin,

I noticed this behaviour in SQL Server 2005 after I applied some of the service packs and updates. This is the reason why I chose the xp_dirtree in order to tunnel my data in DNS. What I noticed was that the xp_fileexists sp worked if you created an OS account and granted it the exact same database permissions as an account residing in the database. I don&#039;t know if this still works and if this is an acceptable work around for you.

Regards,
Patrik</description>

		<description>Is there a work around for the low privileged database user to be able to run xp_fileexists?

This stored proc is used during the restore process, so my low-level users who are dbcreator role can no longer locate backup files.

Thanks,
Erin</description>
