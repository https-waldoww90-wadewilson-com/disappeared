		<description>In my personal opinion, the big difference is the integration into Windows and Outlook. I like the seamless policy based e-mail integration, that allows you to trigger encryption based on keywords, recipients and other outlook specific information. The support for self-extracting files has also proven to be useful. The PGP virtual disks are smooth to work with, and finally now if it does partition based encryption it can replace my other software. So I guess if your looking for a file encryption package and not any of the above additional functionality there are plenty of options. You could most likely also combine multiple free packages to obtain the same functionality.

As for the Truecrypt package it did not allow me to encrypt my XP system/boot partition, which is the reason I went with another commercial package. The Free CompuSec package from &lt;a title=&quot;http://www.ce-infosys.com.sg/&quot; href=&quot;http://www.ce-infosys.com.sg/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.ce-infosys.com.sg/&lt;/a&gt; should be able to do just that though and might also be a suitable replacement. I had some trouble running it in my vmware environment though.</description>

		<description>Wow, this is a pricey piece of software.  What are the benefits of going with this as opposed to something like gpg4win and TrueCrypt, all of which are free and in some cases, open-source?</description>
